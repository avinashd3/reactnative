Step 1: Open Windows PowerShell with Run as Administrator
.
Step 2: use (Get-ExecutionPolicy) this command on Windows PowerShell to see the execution policy
Step 3: Now we need to change this policy to allow the operation. Use this command to make it Unrestricted
.
Use (Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted) this command
.
here you will get a prompt message and you should press 'Y' to change from Restricted to Unrestricted.
Thatâ€™s it.
.
To ensure, you may check the execution policy by this
(Get-ExecutionPolicy) command again.
The possible output should be (Unrestricted)
